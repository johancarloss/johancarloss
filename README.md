# Hi üëã, I'm Johan Carlos

CS student at UFPB, interested in Artificial Intelligence and its practical applications.

Beyond my academic interests, I am a **hands-on back-end developer** focused on building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. I'm driven by the challenge of engineering complex solutions and applying modern software design principles.

### üíª My Core Skills

My practical experience is centered on building and designing modern back-end systems.

* **High-Performance APIs:** Designing and building fast, asynchronous APIs using **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **Pydantic** for robust data validation.

* **Advanced Software Architecture:** Applying **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID** principles to write decoupled, maintainable, and highly testable code (Pytest).

* **System Integration:** Integrating complex, real-time, third-party systems using REST APIs and managing bidirectional data flows via **Webhooks**.
